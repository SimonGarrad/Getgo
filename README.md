Created with CodeSandbox.

This app is a collaborative effort from a team of three and is our first experience using React. CodeSandbox allowed for greater accessibility and collaboration . My primary contributions were the conditional rendering as well as the Rideshare and API functionality. We hadn't learned about modularizing our code by that point, please forgive us!

Please note, this code is likely to be updated in the future.
